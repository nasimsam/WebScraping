**Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data**
<br>
First I used yfinance to extract stock data for Tesla then I used Web scraping to extract Tesla Revenue Data, finally I plotted the Tesla Stock graph to compare stock data with revenue data. I have followed exat same process for GameStop stock data, stock symbol GME, and GameStop Revenue Data and finally, plotted the GameStop graphs.

**URL used for Web Scraping:**

Tesla Revenue Data: "https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0220EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/project/revenue.htm"
<br>
GME Revenue Data:" https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0220EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/project/stock.html"
