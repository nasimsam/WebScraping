**Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data**
<br>
In this project, I extracted some stock data and then displayed this data in a graph. More precisely I used Web scraping to extract Tesla Revenue Data and GME Revenue Data and then used yfinance to extract stock data. Finally, plot the Tesla and GameStop graphs.
<br>
**URL used for Web Scraping:**
<br>
Tesla Revenue Data: "https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0220EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/project/revenue.htm"
<br>
GME Revenue Data:" https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0220EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/project/stock.html"
