**Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data**
<br>
First I used Yahoo finance to extract stock data for Tesla and GameStop then I used Web scraping to extract their Revenue Data, finally I compare the stock data with revenue data by ploting graphs.
<br>
**URL used for Web Scraping:**
<br>
Tesla Revenue Data: "https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0220EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/project/revenue.htm"
<br>
GME Revenue Data:" https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0220EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/project/stock.html"
